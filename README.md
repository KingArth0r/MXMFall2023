#Setup
Make sure you have the latest version of python and have the relevant packages installed.

InitialQuestions.py
To test different polynomials, p values, or n values, go down to the bottom of the file where it says "Input values" change the values to suit your curiosity.
For polynomials, remember that to do exponents in python, you use ** instead of ^, make sure you are using the symbol x for your polynomial. 
Your program may return complex values, but since the imaginary parts are so small, the imaginary part can be ignored for now.
Be careful running the program for large p or n values, it may slow your computer.

MatrixEigenvalues.py
Don't use this for now, it is currently an infinite loop. Results from this are dumped into checked.json which will be cleaned for testing purposes.
